# TTT 17th October 2025 

Attending: Matt, Maarten, Luna, DaveD, TomD
Apologies: Linda, Marcus


## Recap from last time
Performed scoring (using planning poker) for TR-1, reasonable agreement. Revealed a difference in interpretation of values, especially for Likelihood, but these were evened out by doing the exercise as a group. Reveals some improvement could be had in the descriptions to reduce ambiguity. 

Things to watch out for: 
* duplication of information or threats
* unclear descriptions


## Continuation of Assessment

### TR-2
--some clarity needed to the definition as Matt got a little confused

otherwise straight forward voting 3,4,4 and 1,2,2

### TR-3
added incorrect configuration to the description  
DD notes that CILogon bans increasing of scopes as a mitigation.

Impact Voting - 3,3,4,4  
Some discussion over an worse case "infiltration" scenario of a service such as FTS.  
Luna notes in a similar WLCG assessment split threats by privilege level.

Liklihood voting -  2,2,2,3
-Matt went high due to the increased likelihood of a misconfiguration. 2.5 agreed upon.

### TR-6
(4 and 5 are the shared risks)  
A lot of debate as audit gaps are a multiplier on the impact of other risks.  
Greatest spread on vote, 2,2,4,4  
TD - Risk to the incident response process.  
Likelihood - vote - Matt went low as took into account the likelihood of an audit issue compounding with another issue.  
Some debate if this was the right approach.

### TR-7
Straight into voting, noting process speeds up

Somewhat agreed on 4 as impact - whilst it will only likely affect one group at a time, it could be devastating for that group. Likelihood was a 3 - again raised by the chances of the risk being exposed via misconfigurations

### Plan for next meeting
Take on the two threats that have "per workflow" rows, but first consider the generic version of that threat, and see if this applies to any of the specific workflows.


## Next Meeting
Usual time - 15.00 CEST on Tuesday 28th of October, pencilled in as a 90 minute meeting.
